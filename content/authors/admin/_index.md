Hi, my name is Sander Lamballais. I am a PostDoc at the Erasmus MC.

My current work:
* I develop methods related to GWAS, polygenic burden, pleiotropy, and cell-free DNA.
* I study the role of genetics in brain development and psychiatric disorders.
* I coordinate two courses in the new [Genomics in Society](https://www.eur.nl/en/research-master/genomics-society) MSc program:
  * Research Design (2022 onwards) 
  * Biological Statistics (2023 onwards)
* I am working on the following short books:
  * Bash for Non-Programmers (forthcoming)
  * R for Non-Programmers
  * Polygenic Scores for Non-Geneticists

Highlights from my previous work:
* I am the lead developer of [QDECR](https://qdecr.com), an R package to perform vertex-wise analyses. 
* I co-designed and conducted the [ORACLE Study](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-020-00696-3), a cohort of 2,000 individuals with neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and more. I trained and led a team of over 20 BSc, MSc, and PhD students. 
* I wrote [my doctoral thesis](https://pure.eur.nl/en/publications/shaping-the-brain-causes-and-consequences-of-the-changing-brain-a) on how the brain takes shape across a lifetime.

Feel free to reach out if you:
* Want to collaborate
* Need a peer reviewer
* Want to learn more about genetics or neuroimaging
* Have questions about my work
