I am a postdoc in Neurogenetics; I develop methods to study genetics, and I apply those methods to the genetics of the brain. 

I am a member of the [Adams lab](https://www.adamslab.nl) at the Clinical Genetics department of the Erasmus MC (NL). I am the lead developer of the [QDECR R package](https://qdecr.com).
