Hi, my name is Sander Lamballais. 

My current work:
* Genetic methodology: Developing methods related to polygenic burden, pleiotropy, and cell-free DNA.
* Neurogenetics: Applying my and other methods to understand brain development and deterioration.
* Psychiatric genetics: Applying my and other methods to understand the role of genetics in psychiatric disorders.
* I teach Research Design (2022 onwards) and Biological Statistics (2023) in the [Genomics in Society MSc program](https://www.eur.nl/en/research-master/genomics-society).

Highlights from my previous work:
* I am the lead developer of [QDECR](https://qdecr.com), an R package to perform vertex-wise analyses. 
* I co-designed and conducted [the ORACLE Study](doi.org/10.1007/s10654-020-00696-3), a cohort of 2,000 individuals with neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and more. I trained and led a team of over 20 BSc, MSc, and PhD students. 
* I co-authored over 20 papers.

My interests:
* Peer review: I am looking for opportunities to review papers.
* Teaching:
