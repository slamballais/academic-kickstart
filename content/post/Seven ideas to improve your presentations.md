title: Seven ideas to improve your presentations

\---

Sharing your findings is an important part of academia. A common way to do this is by presenting in front of research groups or at conferences. However, making a good presentation can be pretty hard. Over the years, I have seen hundreds of presentations and lectures in different academic fields and different settings. Some of them I still remember, others I have trouble forgetting. Over time, I started noticing some key differences between good and bad presentations. In this blog, I will share seven of those.

Note: This is not a comprehensive list or tutorial for making a good presentation! These are simply some principles/ideas that may give you insights in how to improve your own presentations. 

**1.**    **Let your voice lead and your slides support**

Do you use your voice or the slides to convey specific information? To answer this question, we have to take a step back: Why are we using slides to begin with? Speeches have been around for millennia, yet they do not need Powerpoint to be efficient. Furthermore, using both your voice and slides means that audiences have to focus on two things at the same time, which can be really tricky. So why use slides?

<u>The main reason to add slides to your presentation is because they can support your speech</u>. By both hearing and seeing the information, your audience will likely understand your story better. Furthermore, in order to create mental links between concepts you need to go back to previous information. While you cannot rewind speech, you can look at a slide and simply look at previously presented concepts. Your slides act as a clipboard of information, and thus provide support for understanding your speech.

Two common mistakes in presenting arise from not properly implementing this. First, the information on your slides should follow the story that you are telling. Audiences will lose their attention if you start talking about things that are not on the slides, or if the slides contain different terms than your speech. Second, some presenters will fill their slides with the exact same text (word for word) as the one they are saying. A consequence of this is that people will start focusing on your slides, and so they will lead and your voice will become the support. Consequently, it will be hard to get people back to listening to your story.

**2.**    **Build up information from your audience’s perspective**

A common problem in presentations is that it is not clear to the audience why certain concepts are even discussed. You may have worked months on a project and have gotten familiar with every detail. However, your audience only has minutes to grasp that same body of information. You have to structure the information in a way that the audience can follow along.

<u>You have to consider how information is structured, and how one concepts builds upon other concepts</u>. I always visualize it as a brick wall: In order to get to a certain level, you need to build a strong foundation with the right concepts. 

This analogy has two important implications for presenting new information. First, your audience has to know and understand all the required supporting concepts (bricks). This means that you have to explain all supporting information, or you have to assume that your audience already knows it. Second, your new information has to be relevant, either for supporting subsequent information, or by fulfilling the goals of your presentation (e.g. presenting the findings of your study). Any information that does neither is irrelevant and should be removed from your presentation.

**3.**    **Divide your presentation into independent components**

The use of slides forces us to create units of information. So, what do we present per slide? 

Here, I refer back to tip #2: Consider the building blocks of information. <u>Your presentation should have specific goals (e.g. present your results), and your slides should act as building blocks towards that goal</u>. 

The way that I achieve this, is by taking the following steps. First, I consider what the goals are of my presentation. Second, I consider what information I have and where my presentation should start. Third, I create a rough draft of the narrative thread, i.e. what information I should present in order achieve the goals of my presentation. Fourth, I divide the narrative thread into steps/slides, and for each step/slide I consider what the foundational building blocks are in order to understand them. 

This process will help you structure your presentation, because it shows you where you need to put more emphasis. For example, if you are presenting novel methods then you have to spend more time on explaining those to your audience. The key idea here is that you can divide your slides in any way you want, as long as they support the goals of your presentation and your audience is able to follow along.

**4.**    **Prefer images over text**

<u>Slides should primarily contain images, and should only contain text when it is a better way to convey the information</u>. The reason for this has to do with how your “working memory” functions. The working memory is the part of cognition that you use to temporarily store information and to manipulate it. Interestingly, there are separate channels in your working memory for auditory and visual information. During presentations the auditory channel will be busy processing the presenter’s speech. When you present images on the slides, these will be processed by the visual channel. 

The problem arises with text on slides. Text will actually load into the same channel as the presenter’s speech. In other words, it is much harder to focus on both speech and text than it is to focus on speech and images. This is easy to test for yourself. Watching a Youtube video with audio is no effort, but try reading a book and listening to the Youtube video at the same time. It simply costs more effort.

**5.**    **Present information on slides in chunks**

Whenever you design a slide, try to think of how your audience sees that slide. If you present a lot of information at the same time (e.g. multiple images with text), then your audience likely does not know where to focus their attention. Any time that the audience spends on searching through your slides is time that they won’t pay attention to your story. Some presenters solve this by using a laser pointer, but using a laser pointer too often is distracting in and of itself. 

Y<u>ou can solve this by presenting information in focused pieces</u>. When presenting complex images, you can choose to first only show part of it, and as your story unfolds you can slowly show more and more of the image. This allows you to control where the audience is looking, and it makes it easier for the audience to follow your story. If you are using images from other sources, consider removing words or text that is not relevant to your story. This prevents that your audience will focus on the wrong parts of the images. Finally, when presenting text, try to limit yourself to a maximum of seven lines/rows of text. Any more, and your slide will likely become too cluttered. 

**6.**    **Rehearse the presentation both during and after design**

It is important to go through the presentation a couple of times while you are creating it. While it is good to think of a general structure beforehand (see #3), it may turn out that it does not work as well as you thought. <u>The best way to discover this, is by going through your slides while still designing them, and seeing how well the story flows</u>. You may realize that some parts do not logically build up (see #2) or that the slides are not really working (see #4). Don’t be afraid to change things when you notice this!

Similarly, once the presentation is done, you have to go through it at least once. Don’t memorize the presentation word by word. You should rather memorize the main message of each slide, and the other in which the slides appear. By going through the presentation a couple of times, you will slowly realize how to best convey the information on each slide and the story as a whole.

**7.**    **Add your personal flair**

Finally, do not forget that this is your presentation. <u>Do not be afraid to give it your personal twist</u>. For example, I like to put in some jokes, because that is just how I like to present. You can put in some funny images if you would like to. Just do not overdo it, and always remain professional.
